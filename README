Programming Assignment 3: Clustering via Hadoop

This is actually done with Spark.

You will need the spark-repl jar that is not included in this repo. To generate
the jar, do:

$ git clone git@github.com:mesos/spark.git
$ cd spark
$ sbt/sbt assembly

Copy the spark-repl jar to lib directory.

Then you can run Spark shell with 20 threads using:

MASTER=local[20] ./spark-shell
